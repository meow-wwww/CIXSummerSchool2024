# Instructions

**IMPORTANT** you must pull the submodules to get the notes! Run:

```
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

to make sure they are downloaded.

(But this directory is a re-upload of the original repository, so all materials should be here already.)

# Installation

* Create a virtual environment (e.g. if using conda `conda create -n cix2024_jhw`)
* Activate it (if necessary, e.g. `conda activate cix2024_jhw`)
* Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Open  `lecture_notes/01_Introduction.ipynb`
