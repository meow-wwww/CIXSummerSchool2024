These models are trained on vast datasets containing diverse text sources and can perform a variety of language-related tasks, such as text completion, translation, summarization, and answering questions. Examples include OpenAI\\'s GPT-3 and GPT-4.\\n\\n3. **Linked List Manager (LLM):** In computer science, LLM can also refer to software or a component within an operating system that manages linked lists, which are data structures consisting of nodes that contain data and pointers to other nodes.\\n\\nIf you provide additional context, I can give a more specific explanation tailored to your needs.', id='run-bf8cf6ea-df69-4cd9-9725-73cfcf687311-0')"
